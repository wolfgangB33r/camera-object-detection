# Pretrained model attributation

The pretrained binary model (binary file with extension .pb and .pbtxt) was downloaded and originates from Model Zoo. Those files contain both topology and weights of the trained network. You may download one of them from Model Zoo, in example ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco (MobileNet-SSD trained on COCO dataset).
